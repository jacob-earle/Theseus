This is the standard setup on x86."],["IrqStatusRegisters","Each PIC chip has two interrupt status registers:  the In-Service Register (ISR) and the Interrupt Request Register (IRR).  The ISR tells us which interrupts are currently being serviced, meaning IRQs sent to the CPU.  The IRR tells us which interrupts have been raised, but not necessarily serviced yet.  Based on the interrupt mask, the PIC will send interrupts from the IRR to the CPU,  at which point they are marked in the ISR. see http://wiki.osdev.org/8259_PIC#ISR_and_IRR"]]});
